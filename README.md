1. Unit testing
2. testing with pytest
3. PHPUnit testing - Backend
4. Jest testing - Frontend
5. Github Actions
6. Generative AI (testing)

For the backend I am using the same from the previous homework: https://github.com/Freddy444/Comp333-react-backend

# Problem 1: unit testing
To run my answer for the first problem. Simply run 'python3 unit_testing.py'. This should give you the wanted output.
 
# Problem 2: Testing with pytest

'test_script.py' contains unit tests for the functions in the `unit_testing_sample_code.py` script. These tests are implemented using the pytest framework.


## Setup

1. Install pytest using the following command:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Ensure that the unit_testing_sample_code.py is in the same directory as this test script, which in this case is 'test_script.py'.


2. Running the Tests

pytest test_script.py

After running `pytest test_script.py` in your terminal, pytest will run the tests in the `test_script.py` file. The output will say whether each test passed or failed.
