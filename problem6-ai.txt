Generative AI could be used to assist in testing. For this to work you need to give the AI sufficient infromation to work
with and a prompt that is specific enough. One way to do this is to feed it information on the
task you wish to do and then feed it any of the code you aready have for the AI to work with. Lets say I 
want to render tests fro my input fields in my loginview.js file. I can load the tests by give it this prompt:


ChatGPT prompt:

"I want to render tests for each of my input fields in my loginview.js file with jest testing. Here
is my loginview.js file: [Paste the code from loginview.js]."


Output:

In the answer they gave me, it had the test I needed which was: 

  test('renders login form with input fields', () => {
    render(<LoginView />);
    
    // Ensure the username and password input fields are present
    const usernameInput = screen.getByPlaceholderText('Username');
    const passwordInput = screen.getByPlaceholderText('Password');
    
    expect(usernameInput).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(passwordInput).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
